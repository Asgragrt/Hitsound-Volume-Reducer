# Hitsounds Volume Reducer

Reduce hitsounds volume :D

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure FFmpeg it's added properly to the path.

1. Install FFmpeg[^1] [^2].
2. Move `HitsoundsVolumeReducer.bat` to the skin folder.
3. Run the file :D

The file moves the original files to a subfolder `original_subfolder`.
If it fails to modify the sound file (as with empty files) it will just copy the original file.
